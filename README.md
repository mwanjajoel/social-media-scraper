# Data Scraper Experiment
This notebook demonstrates the use of [SNScrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape) to scrape data from the Social Media sites like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. 

## Objectives
The outcome of these experiments is to learn how to use the [SNScrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape) library to scrape tweets from the Twitter API so as to automate reporting.

## Setup
Clone the repo and setup a virtual environment. Then run the notebooks! 

## NOTICE
This is a work in progress. I am still working on the code and the documentation. I am also still learning how to use the library. I am happy to share my thoughts and suggestions.

Also please be guided that this source code was written for educational purposes only. 
Scraping data from the internet is a dangerous activity and should be used with caution.
